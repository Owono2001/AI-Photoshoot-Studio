# AI Photoshoot Studio

Welcome to the AI Photoshoot Studio! This is a web application designed to let you upload photos, apply various fun effects (including AI-powered ones), and create photobooth-style compositions.

**Access the Live Application:**

**(Note:** The application is hosted on a free tier, so it might take 30-60 seconds to load if it has been inactive. Performance for AI effects may also be slower than on a local machine.)*
