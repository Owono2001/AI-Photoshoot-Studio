## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the AI Photoshoot Studio locally.

### Prerequisites

*   **Python:** Version 3.8 or higher. ([Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
*   **pip:** Python package installer (usually comes with Python).
*   **Git:** Version control system. ([Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
*   **(Optional but Recommended) Virtual Environment:** Tools like `venv` or `conda` to isolate project dependencies.
*   **C++ Build Tools:** May be required by some dependencies (like `dlib` if used indirectly, or for building `tensorflow` / `opencv` from source if needed, though pre-built wheels usually work). Check your OS documentation (e.g., Build Tools for Visual Studio on Windows, `build-essential` on Debian/Ubuntu).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Owono2001/AI-Photoshoot-Studio.git # Replace with your actual repo link later
    cd AI-Photoshoot-Studio
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    # Using venv (built-in)
    python -m venv venv
    # Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file (see below if you don't). Then run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note: Installing TensorFlow and OpenCV can sometimes be tricky depending on your OS and hardware (CPU/GPU). Refer to their official installation guides if you encounter issues.*

4.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the project root directory. Add the following line, replacing the value with your own strong, random secret key:
    ```env
    # .env
    FLASK_SECRET_KEY='YOUR_VERY_STRONG_AND_SECRET_KEY_HERE_f9a3b1...'
    # Optional: Specify a different Style Transfer Model URL
    # STYLE_TRANSFER_MODEL_URL='https://tfhub.dev/google/magenta/arbitrary-image-stylization-v1-256/2'
    # Optional: Configure Flask run settings (defaults are 127.0.0.1:5000, debug=False)
    # FLASK_RUN_HOST='0.0.0.0' # To make accessible on local network
    # FLASK_RUN_PORT=8080
    # FLASK_DEBUG='True' # Enable debug mode for development ONLY
    ```
    **Important:** The `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` is crucial for session security. Keep it secret!

5.  **(If needed) Create `requirements.txt`:**
    If you don't have this file, you can generate it based on the imports in `app.py`. A likely list is:
    ```txt
    # requirements.txt
    Flask
    Flask-Session
    opencv-python
    Pillow
    numpy
    mediapipe
    tensorflow
    tensorflow_hub
    python-dotenv
    # Add any other direct dependencies identified
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Ensure your virtual environment is activated.**
2.  **Run the Flask development server:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
3.  **Open your web browser** and navigate to the address shown in the terminal (usually `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`).

## üìñ Usage

1.  **Load an Image:** Either click "Upload File" to select an image from your device or click "Start Webcam", grant permission, and then "Capture Frame".
2.  **(Optional) Edit:** Use the tools above the "Source Editor" canvas (Select, Draw, Text, Delete, Clear Edits) to modify your source image.
3.  **(Optional) Photobooth:** If the webcam is active, configure layout/shots/GIF options under "Photobooth Fun!", click "Start Photobooth", and follow the countdowns.
4.  **Choose an Effect:** Select the desired effect from the "Choose Effect" dropdown.
5.  **Adjust Parameters:** If parameters appear under "Adjust Parameters", tweak them to your liking. (Note: For AI effects like VBG or Style Transfer, you might need to upload an additional background or style image).
6.  **Apply Effect:** Click the "Apply Backend Effect" button. Wait for the processing (AI effects can take longer).
7.  **View & Download:** The processed image will appear in the "Processed Result" box. Click "Download Result" to save it.

*(Refer to the "How to Use This App" section within the application itself for detailed, step-by-step guidance with icons!)*
