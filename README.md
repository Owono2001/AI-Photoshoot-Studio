## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Ready to run the studio locally? Follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

* **Python:** 3.8+ ([Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
* **pip:** Python package manager (usually included with Python)
* **Git:** Version control ([Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
* **(Recommended) Virtual Environment:** `venv` or `conda`
* **C++ Build Tools:** Potentially needed for some dependencies (check OS specifics: e.g., Build Tools for Visual Studio [Win], `build-essential` [Debian/Ubuntu]).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Owono2001/AI-Photoshoot-Studio.git](https://github.com/Owono2001/AI-Photoshoot-Studio.git) # TODO: Replace with your FINAL repo link
    cd AI-Photoshoot-Studio
    ```

2.  **Setup Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    # Using venv
    python -m venv venv
    # Activate:
    # Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: TensorFlow/OpenCV installation can vary. Check their official docs if issues arise.)*

4.  **Configure Environment:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your secret key:
    ```env
    # .env
    FLASK_SECRET_KEY='REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_OWN_VERY_STRONG_SECRET_KEY_f9a3b1...'

    # Optional overrides for Flask settings:
    # FLASK_RUN_HOST='0.0.0.0' # Accessible on local network
    # FLASK_RUN_PORT=8080
    # FLASK_DEBUG='True' # Development ONLY - Never use in production!

    # Optional Style Transfer Model:
    # STYLE_TRANSFER_MODEL_URL='[https://tfhub.dev/google/magenta/arbitrary-image-stylization-v1-256/2](https://tfhub.dev/google/magenta/arbitrary-image-stylization-v1-256/2)'
    ```
    **Security:** Your `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` must be kept private!

5.  **(If missing) Generate `requirements.txt`:**
    Based on `app.py` imports, a likely list is:
    ```txt
    # requirements.txt
    Flask>=2.0
    Flask-Session>=0.4
    opencv-python>=4.5
    Pillow>=9.0
    numpy>=1.20
    mediapipe>=0.8
    tensorflow>=2.8 # Or tensorflow-cpu
    tensorflow_hub>=0.12
    python-dotenv>=0.19
    ```
    *(Consider adding version specifiers for better reproducibility)*

### Running the App

1.  **Activate your virtual environment.**
2.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
3.  **Visit:** Open your browser to the URL provided (typically `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`).

## üìñ How to Use

1.  **Get Your Image:** Use "Upload File" or "Start Webcam" followed by "Capture Frame".
2.  **Edit (Optional):** Use the tools (Select, Draw, Text, Delete, Clear) above the "Source Editor".
3.  **Try Photobooth (Optional):** With the webcam active, find "Photobooth Fun!", set options, click "Start Photobooth", and smile!
4.  **Apply Effects (To Single Source Image):** Select an effect and adjust its parameters, then click "Apply Backend Effect".
5.  **Download Your Creation:** Click "Download Result" below the processed image.

*(Tip: The "How to Use This App" section within the application itself provides more detailed, illustrated steps!)*

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

* **Browser Compatibility:** For the best experience, use a modern browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.
* **Webcam Access:** The app requires permission to access your webcam for the "Webcam" and "Photobooth" features.
* **File Size Limits:** Uploaded images are limited to 100MB.
* **Processing Time:** Some effects, especially AI-powered ones (Virtual Background, Style Transfer), can take a noticeable amount of time to process on the server. Please be patient.
* **Photobooth Frame Disclaimer:** The photobooth frame feature is still under development. While basic frames are supported, more complex frame designs might exhibit stretching or alignment issues, particularly with non-square layouts.
* **Audio Playback:** The application uses your device's speakers to provide audio feedback. Ensure that audio output is enabled and the volume is at an audible level.
